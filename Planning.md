# Planning
Thinking about how much time per week and overall duration
1. 6 hours per 2 months
2. Thinking about what things we want to showcase with the project
    - Showcase good practices and backend architecture
    - Showcase cloud platform integration (Firebase/Azure)
    - Showcase understanding of CI/CD (GitLab free tier)
    - Learn about AI
3. Thinking about project stages
    - Planning and estimation (see what goes in, what doesn't, what would be best for the first version)
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - Testing (BE: Postman, then FE: Atom?)
4. Thinking about what we will do exactly
	1. Personal finances
		1. Reader of invoices/receipts and data processing with AI
		2. Budgets
		3. Help in seeing where you're spending the most
		4. Integration with national banks
		5. Dynamic daily limit
	2. Shopping assistant
		1.  Reader of invoices/receipts and data processing with AI
		2. Reader of text/audio and data processing with AI
		3. Price comparison based on previous purchases and other people
		4. List creator and assistant to choose where to go based on where you live
Invoice/receipt reader
Audio/text reader
Expected outcome:
"hipermaxi"

|product|qty|price|
|--|--|--|
|milk|2|20|
|bread|4|4|
|paper|1|20|
|meat|1|35|

audio reader
AI module (LLM)
|product|qty|price
|--|--|--|
|milk|2|20|
|bread|4|4|
|paper|1|20|
|meat|1|35|

And then with the AI module (LLM)
convert it to JSON with a certain format

    {
    
	    "milk" : {
    
	    "quantity": 2,
    
	    "price": 20
    
    },
    
	    "rest of products":{}
    
    }

AI module
3. Speech to technology diagram diagrams (PlantUML)
4. Market creator and recipes with quantities (could be a module of b or its own application)
5.  Efficient processing and simplification of text entered by the user to simplify the system.

        9. Think about how to handle different quantities (units, gr, kg).
        10. Think about how to handle different ways of putting the same product (possibly using LLMs).
1kg of meat
1000g of cow meat
2 pounds of cowâ€™s back

4 egg package

	 3. Create a **desired** shopping list.

	  4. The application will give you a summary after finishing a purchase by evaluating against previous purchases.
	        1. Design data model for comparison summary.
	        2. Implement purchase comparator.
	        3. I want to know if the price went up.
	        4. I want to know if I got ripped off.
	        5. Solve the problem of how to process new global data once and then be able to access the processed data with price averages.
	        6. For now, we've decided not to save the summary, just to display it. Reconsider when we get to this point.
	  5. The application compares prices with past purchases and recommends a place.
	        1. Design data model for comparison.
	        2. Implement purchase comparator.
	        3. I want to know where it will be cheapest to buy the items on my list.
	        4. I want it to give me 3 default place recommendations.
	        5. I want it to order the places from cheapest to most expensive (maybe include distance in the result).
	        6. Solve the problem of how to process new global data once and then be able to access the processed data with price averages.

1. Invoice/receipt reader and data processing with AI
    1. I can scan or take a photo of an invoice/receipt for the application to generate a list automatically.
        1. Implement Image to Text reader.
        2. Design intermediate data model between the shopping list and the invoice
        3. Implement LLM to erase all unnecessary text, and convert the invoice data to the intermediate data model.
2. Text/audio reader and data processing with AI | Nice to have
3. Automated list creation based on previous purchases | Nice to have
4. Suggestion of how much product is needed based on people or portions | Nice to have

Note: We have to see how we handle metric units
